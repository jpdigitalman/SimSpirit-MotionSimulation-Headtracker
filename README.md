# SimSpirit HeadTracker

The SimSpirit HeadTracker is a crucial component of the SimSpirit Motion Simulator platform, offering precise head movement tracking for an immersive and realistic simulation experience. This README provides an overview of the HeadTracker module, including its features, integration instructions, and additional information on supported IMUs.

## Features

- **BNO085 or LSM6DS3 IMU**: The HeadTracker supports two options for the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The user can choose between the BNO085 and LSM6DS3 IMU, depending on their preferences and requirements.
- **BNO085 Stability**: The BNO085 IMU, known for its stability, provides reliable and accurate tracking of head movements, including yaw, pitch, and roll.
- **LSM6DS3 Sensitivity**: The LSM6DS3 IMU offers high precision and sensitivity, ensuring precise and responsive tracking of head orientation.
- **Automatic Calibration**: The HeadTracker simplifies calibration by implementing an automatic calibration process. Simply press the calibration button once, and the calibration will be performed automatically.
- **ESPnow Communication**: To pair the HeadTracker with the SimSpirit mainboard, the ESPnow protocol is utilized. Pairing requires the use of the mainboard's MAC address to establish a connection.

## Getting Started

To integrate the SimSpirit HeadTracker into your SimSpirit Motion Simulator setup, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the selected IMU (BNO085 or LSM6DS3) to the HeadTracker module according to the provided pinout and wiring instructions.
2. **Software Configuration**: Install the necessary software libraries and dependencies specific to the chosen IMU on your development environment.
3. **Mainboard Integration**: Use the ESPnow protocol to pair the HeadTracker with the SimSpirit mainboard. Ensure you have the MAC address of the mainboard for the pairing process.
4. **Automatic Calibration**: Simply press the calibration button on the HeadTracker module once to initiate the automatic calibration process. The module will handle the calibration automatically.
5. **Integration with SimSpirit**: Integrate the HeadTracker module with the SimSpirit software or firmware to enable real-time tracking of head movements and synchronization with the simulation.
6. **Testing and Fine-Tuning**: Test the HeadTracker module in various simulation scenarios to ensure accurate tracking and make any necessary adjustments for optimal performance.
